HTML Export - Export drupal paths to HTML.

The 2.x branch is a total rewrite of the HTML Export module.  It now provides developer support for custom path
selection and page rewrites of paths / data. It also now supports non-node paths and will render any drupal path.

Potential improvements

TODO - perhaps add a function to switch off blocks which are forms. E.g. user login.
TODO - exclude particular menu paths. Exclude particular nodes? Maybe for each option offer an exclusion mechanism
